# RockPaperScissorsGame

This project allows users to play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in an online setting with the computer.

The user and computer will choose either rock, paper, or scissors
and the program will output whether the game ended in a win, loss, or tie for the user.
The program will also reveal the computer's choice.

After each game, the user will have the option to either play another game or quit.
If the user decides to quit, the total number of wins, losses, and ties will be displayed.
